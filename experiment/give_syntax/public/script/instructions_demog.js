      <p>This study is part of a larger project that is exploring children's 
      cognitive development. Therefore, the study will use a simple design 
      that will allow us to compare your adult judgments to those of children. 
      You will be asked to play a game that involves making simple judgments 
      about images, words, or quantities.</p>
