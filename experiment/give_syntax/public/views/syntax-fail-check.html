                    <h1>Thank you for participating in the study.</h1>
                    <p>In this study, we used a comprehension check to make sure you understand
                        the instructions that are necessary to complete the rest of the study.
                        Unfortunately, you did not complete the comprehension check within the number 
                        of tries we require.
                    </p>
                    <p>Therefore, we ask that you <b>exit the study and return the submission</b>.
                        Your data will not be used for any future reports or publications of this study. 
                        We really value your time, and please reach out through Prolific if you have any concerns.</p>
